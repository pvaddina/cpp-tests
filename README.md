# CPP-Tests

A repo dedicated for all kinds of CPP tests. Topics covered so far include, modern cpp features (c++11,14), multi-threading support (mostly since c++11), generic programming with templates (both c++98 and c++11), and patterns and concepts. These examples are meant to be a reference for me more than anything else. All the projects are integrated with CMake and it is also planned to integrate AppVeyor for continuous integration. Theoritically one would only need a CPP compiler with C++11 support and CMake, to run all the examples.
